        <h1> Introduction </h1>
        <p> I am an Associate Lecturer in Computer Science with experience teaching foundational modules such as Quantitative Data Analysis, Logic and Computation, and Information and Communication Technologies. My teaching focuses on delivering complex concepts in clear, accessible ways while actively engaging students in the learning process. I design my teaching around clarity, interaction, and consistent support, ensuring that students build confidence as well as competence.</p>

        <h1> Teaching Philosophy</h1>
        <p>My teaching focuses on clarity, interaction, and practical learning. I break down complex 
            concepts into accessible steps, encourage questions, and use visual and applied examples. 
            I believe that students learn best through practice, 
            feedback, and a supportive environment where everyone feels confident to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this purpose, I always insure that my slides are clear and students can review them easity. 
            For engagment, I design class activities for smaller cohorts and polls for larger cohorts where 
            walking around the class and interacting with each student is not possible. That way all stuents 
            get the chance to get involved. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I ask for feddback from every class I teach or every student that I supervise. The feedback
            can be found on <a href="student-reviews.html">Student Reviews</a> page where I provide a summary
            of what I have received. I make sure that the students fell heard and try my best to act upon the feedback
            where I can.

        <h1> Teaching Innovation</h1>
        <p>
            With the fast development of AI, it is important to be aware of using these tools for a better
            teaching experience and prepare ourselves for the overuse of students of these tools.
            To stay on top of these tools, I keep myself updated with the news of AI and try to design 
            materials that cannot be answered easily by AI; or if the answers provided by the students is 
            written by AI, it is obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the otherhand, I use AI tools to understand the concepts better myself, or create tools
            for better learning; trying to create a learning opportunity for every student with different needs. 
            For example, for students who learn by listening, creating AI-made podcasts that summarise the content
            is helpful. For the ones who learn visually, creating interactive slides and infographics is the key.
            Every student has their need and I see it as a duty of myself as a lecturer to try and meet them.

        <ul>

        <h1> Supervision Experience</h1>
        <p>
            I have supervised Final Year projects for undergraduate degrees and dissertations for master students.
            I guide the students through the whole process, from ideation to writing and project delivery. 
            During this time, I provide constant feedback to the students while trying to encourage students to develop
            independent thinking by providing structured support.
