  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>Hello! I’m <b>Leila Ghanbar</b>, an associate lecturer in Computer Science at Brunel University of London.</p>
  <p>This is my personal academic website, where I share my teaching work, projects, and academic interests.</p>

    <h1 id="profile"> Profile</h1>
    <p>
      With a background in biology and a master's degree in engineering, I am a Jack of all trades which is why I persued my PhD 
      in computational biology to bridge the knowledge of biology to modelling, using my engineering mindset. I am creative and curious 
      I keen to learn new things. To teach any subject, I first learn them myself and try different resources of this goal. This gives
      me the oppotunity to be comfortable with different subjects, enough to teach them; and to find out which resources offer the 
      best features for learning to the students. With this first-hand experience, I can offer my students a better tools for learning
      and understanding the contents.

    <p>
      I have a vast interest in different fields, some I have never had a chance to work in as a researcher and some I have delved into.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Modelling and Simulation of biological networks at a cellular and multi-cellular level. This aligned with my PhD perfectly. </li>
      <li> Development of computational tools for model abstraction and simplification in biology. While modelling biological networks
        in Petri nets for my PhD, I realied that there are no tools in the market that can satisfy my taste for modelling in detail. 
        I have developed an idea of what this software needs to have and how it would look like and I would work on it with a PhD student.
      </li>
      <li>
        Application of AI in Healthcare and Biology. It is a far topic from what I originally completed in my PhD, but it always 
        interests me to enhance AI for purposes that matter. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Automation and optimisation of academic workflows and teaching administration.
        As a lecturer, I find marking is one of the least productive times of the year. Considering the advancement of AI, I am intersted
        to create a safe AI tool that can mark the courseworks of the students effectively. This would save time that could be used for 
        research purposes.
